# squad-scheduler
A scheduler that automatically creates a weekly schedule for our squad.

Before this project started, we used to write our schedules ourselves, which was both time-consuming and difficult.
The goal of this project is to help us save time and miimize the effort required to revise our schedule.

Our schedule consists of four shifts: morning, afternoon, evening, and night.
- Morning: 07:30 to 11:30
- Afternoon: 11:30 to 17:30
- Evening: 17:30 to 22:00
- Night: 22:00 to 07:30
